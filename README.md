This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using Langchain, OpenRouterAI API, and FAISS for vector similarity search. It demonstrates how to combine LLMs with external knowledge bases to build smarter, context-aware applications.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Langchain – For orchestration of LLM chains and tools

OpenRouterAI API – For accessing multiple LLM providers via a unified API

FAISS – For efficient vector similarity search and retrieval

Python – Primary language for development

💡 Features:
Document ingestion and embedding with FAISS

Contextual retrieval from the knowledge base

Seamless integration with multiple LLMs via OpenRouterAI

Modular and extendable RAG pipeline using Langchain

🚀 Use Cases:
Chatbots with custom knowledge

Semantic search applications

Question-answering systems over private datasets

Research assistants and documentation tools
